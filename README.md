Bin
===

Binary executable files (.exe, .dll, etc.) that either implement Essence#, or are produced by the Essence# compiler.

Currently, all the binary executables in the repository are ones that implement Essence#, because the Essence# compiler is not yet able to generate binary executable files.

The repository is organized first by processor architecture (x86, x64), then by .Net framework version: .Net 3.5 -> 35; .Net 4.0+ -> 40, and finally by whether the code was compiled for debugging (Debug) or for use in production (Release.)
